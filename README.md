# [CS50p-2022](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)
This repository contains my CS50p 2022 Problem set solutions.

You will find the link for each problem set specifications on the _Week_ title above.

## _DISCLAIMER_:

This repository is intended just to share my own solution to the problem sets. Remember that the main goal is to improve your coding abilities, so first try to solve the problems yourself. Copy the code form others is a violation of the [__CS50's Academic Honesty__](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/honesty/).
